A bean is an Object that makes the backbone of Spring application
In order for an Object to be called Spring bean the object must be instantiated and retrieved from the IOC container

good candidate for being a bean
-------------------------------

1) Objects that cost a lot to create and used across the application. Ex - Repositories, Services
2) A bean is managed by IOC container
3) Beans are by default Singleton


Not suitable being a Bean
-------------------------

Domain Objects like Book, Order, Product

Bean Scopes 
-----------

1) Singleton - default behavior. 
2) prototype - an instance is created everytime getBean is called
3) request (web only)
4) session - (web only)

There are 2 ways to resolve the issue of bean scope prototype from bean scope Singleton - 

Make the singleton Bean implement ApplicationContextAware - check the examples
Use method injection to resolve this issue.

If a bean has both constructor and property Injections then both are invoked when bean is created.
