It is not recommended to use Java configuration with properties file as it to too cumbersome and not well documented.

How Spring parses the configuration
-----------------------------------

Spring reads each bean definition and constructs it. Refer to the context file "appilcation-context-bean-lifecycle1.xml"
It reads and constructs BeanA and then BeanB using the constructor.
After constructing the bean it injects the properties of the bean. 
First it injects BeanB message property and then injects the instance of beanB into beanA.
A bean's "destroy-method" is invoked when the applicationContext that initialized that bean is closed. Refer to the class - "ApplicationBeanLifeCycle1"

For running a specific profile add "VM arguments" - "-Dspring.profiles.active=PROD" in eclipse. Refer to the class "ApplicationProfiles.java" and "application-context-profiles.xml"
