BY default beans scope is singleton. 
Use AutoWire annotation for either constructor or setter method OR the attribute itself

Normally we use @Component, @ComponentScan and @Autowired are used with the beans we create.
Explicit Type of wiring with Java is normally used with third party components like Hibernate session manager. 
All the configurations that can be used with Bean configuration like @Qualifier, @Lazy,... can be used with Java Annotations as well.
Java Based configuration is not a 100% replacement for xml based configuration. So it should always be possible to fall back on the XML configuration.
