Connections are expensive to produce as they demand a lot of resources.
All of the Spring Data Access Components obtain their connections by using an implementation of DataSource interface. It's basically a ConnectionFactory.

RowMapper invokes once per row
ResultSetExtractor invokes once per resultset 

Any time u want to perform insert, update or delete statement then we should use "update" method on the jdbctemplate

To get these working I added the dependencies - 
spring-jdbc
commons-pool
commons-dbcp
commons-collections
