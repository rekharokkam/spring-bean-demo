Where do we persist data
------------------------
File IO
Message Queue
No SQL Database
Object Databases
Relational Database

How do we persist Data with Java
-------------------------------
Java Database Connectivity [JDBC] - basic - Obtain a connection, working with statement
Java Persistence Architecture [JPA] - similar to an ORM but it is a standardized approach to use Object relational mapper
Java Transaction API [JTA] - working with a full blown application server implementation to persist data. With JTA we can persist data to multiple data sources at the same time
Java Database Objects [JDO] - writing to an Object database
Object Relational Mapping [ORM] - ORM and JAP are very closely tied - Hibernate and eclipseLink

What roles does Spring play 
---------------------------
Spring provides "Data Access Support".


Persist Object model into Data Model

Persistence Structure
---------------------

Refer to the pic - Persitence_Structure.jpg.
When we use repositories we often program to an interface. Ex - if there is a book table then 
Book - Entity
BookRepository - Interface that defines different operations on the book table
One Implementation of BookRepository could be to persist in the database, another implementation could be persist in the file system.
Spring Data Support objects help us persist the information. Spring Data Support Objects are - templates for JDBC, JPA.
